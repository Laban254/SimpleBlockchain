# Blockchain Project TODO

- [ ] **User Authentication and Authorization**
  - **Missing**: There is no user authentication or authorization.
  - **Action**: Implement JWT or another token-based system to track transactions and control access.

- [ ] **Transaction Details**
  - **Missing**: Additional transaction details like notes or tags are not supported.
  - **Action**: Enhance the `new_transaction` method to accept and store extra fields.

- [ ] **Transaction Fees**
  - **Missing**: There is no implementation for transaction fees.
  - **Action**: Introduce fees to incentivize miners and simulate a more realistic environment.

- [ ] **Node Communication**
  - **Missing**: There's no network setup for multiple nodes to communicate and synchronize.
  - **Action**: Implement a peer-to-peer network to allow nodes to share and synchronize blocks.

- [ ] **Consensus Algorithms**
  - **Missing**: Only the Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm is implemented.
  - **Action**: Explore and implement other consensus algorithms like Proof of Stake (PoS) or Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) for a more robust system.

- [ ] **Security Measures**
  - **Missing**: There is no encryption for sensitive data, and no simulation of attacks.
  - **Action**: Add encryption for data protection and simulate attacks to test system resilience.

- [ ] **Advanced Blockchain Features**
  - **Missing**: Smart contracts and tokenomics are not implemented.
  - **Action**: Explore smart contract functionality and develop a token economy within your blockchain.

- [ ] **Real-World Data Integration**
  - **Missing**: There's no integration with real-world data through external APIs.
  - **Action**: Incorporate real-time data (e.g., market prices) into your blockchain transactions or smart contracts.
