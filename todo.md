# Blockchain Project TODO

## 1. User Authentication and Authorization
- **Missing**: There is no user authentication or authorization.
- **Action**: Implement JWT or another token-based system to track transactions and control access.

## 2. Transaction Details
- **Missing**: Additional transaction details like notes or tags are not supported.
- **Action**: Enhance the `new_transaction` method to accept and store extra fields.

## 3. Transaction Fees
- **Missing**: There is no implementation for transaction fees.
- **Action**: Introduce fees to incentivize miners and simulate a more realistic environment.

## 4. Node Communication
- **Missing**: There's no network setup for multiple nodes to communicate and synchronize.
- **Action**: Implement a peer-to-peer network to allow nodes to share and synchronize blocks.

## 5. Consensus Algorithms
- **Missing**: Only the Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm is implemented.
- **Action**: Explore and implement other consensus algorithms like Proof of Stake (PoS) or Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) for a more robust system.

## 6. Security Measures
- **Missing**: There is no encryption for sensitive data, and no simulation of attacks.
- **Action**: Add encryption for data protection and simulate attacks to test system resilience.

## 7. Advanced Blockchain Features
- **Missing**: Smart contracts and tokenomics are not implemented.
- **Action**: Explore smart contract functionality and develop a token economy within your blockchain.

## 8. Real-World Data Integration
- **Missing**: There's no integration with real-world data through external APIs.
- **Action**: Incorporate real-time data (e.g., market prices) into your blockchain transactions or smart contracts.
